## Description

This package contains functions that calculate the:

* standard inertia tensor
* reduced inertia tensor
* iterative reduced inertia tensor


## Requirements

In order to use the functions in this package, you will need the following Python packages installed:

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org)
* [astropy](http://www.astropy.org)
* [rotations](https://github.com/duncandc/rotations)
